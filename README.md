# Coffee
CLI program for Windows that will prevent the system from going to sleep.
---

**Coffee** is CLI program for Microsoft Windows based systems. I was inspired by the command `caffeinate` on Mac systems that is used to prevent them in entering sleep mode. So I wrote my own version of this command for Microsoft Windows and it quickly became my most used command or program. Simply type `coffee` in the Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell from the directory where you saved the program and your system will show a nice ASCII cup of coffee on the terminal and will stay awake. To stop the program use Ctrl-C or close the terminal window.
